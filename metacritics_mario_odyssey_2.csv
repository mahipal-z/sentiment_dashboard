negative,"Super Mario Odyssey isn't exactly the greatest game I've ever played and I play alot of games, the game is kind of boring, most of the moons feel like you're just handed to you and that kills any real satisfaction since people are just most likely going to just explore anyway. Each kingdom isn't as big as people think they are infact they are relatively small compared and the soundtrack is rather forgettable aswell...I would go on but I know people will dismiss this as ""hate"" when it clearly is pointing out the flaws in Odyssey.",4
neutral,"Cada 5 minutos el juego cambia completamente, sobre la misma base. La historia principal solo lleva unas 15h, pero el meollo empieza después. Es toda una lección de diseño de niveles que dará that hablar por muchos a years.",1
positive,"The only negative thing I can think of is that after ""completing"" the game, you can go back and collect more moons from each stage. Overall, though, it's just incredible.. The best game of 2017 I've played so far and for sure one of the best Switch title. Perfect level design and really nice graphic. A lot of fun for both child and a bit older gamer..",3
