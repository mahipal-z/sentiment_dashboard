The last one I played was Mario 64, and while I enjoyed it for a while, I've never gone back to it.But Odyssey is kind of amazing.  It plays like an updated version of Ocarina of Time, yet with Kirby-like power stealing mechanics.  Brilliant decisions, both.  We get a format we're familiar with, intuitive controls, and satisfying abilities.I didn't think I liked Mario games anymore.

Overall, though, it's just incredible.",night4,positive
9541,Super Mario Odyssey,Switch,4,"Super Mario Odyssey isn't exactly the greatest game I've ever played and I play alot of games, the game is kind of boring, most of the moons feel like you're just handed to you and that kills any real satisfaction since people are just most likely going to just explore anyway, which brings me onto my next point, each kingdom isn't as big as people think they are infact they are relativelySuper Mario Odyssey isn't exactly the greatest game I've ever played and I play alot of games, the game is kind of boring, most of the moons feel like you're just handed to you and that kills any real satisfaction since people are just most likely going to just explore anyway, which brings me onto my next point, each kingdom isn't as big as people think they are infact they are relatively small compared and the soundtrack is rather forgettable aswell...I would go on but I know people will dismiss this as ""hate"" when it clearly is pointing out the flaws in Odyssey.",Kaitos,negative
9542,Super Mario Odyssey,Switch,9,The best game of 2017 I've played so far and for sure one of the best Switch title. Perfect level design and really nice graphic. A lot of fun for both child and a bit older gamer.,mosiu666,positive
9543,Super Mario Odyssey,Switch,5,"            This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.        SPOILERS AHEADSo the gameplay was fun and all but what really pissed me off was the story:You play this little man trying to save a princess from this bowser chad who wants to ""force""-marry her to him (isn't this a bit **** up by itself?) and after you went through all those worlds to find out that bowser stole something special from each world for the wedding, you arrive at the moon to crash the wedding bowser spent so much time setting up (I still don't understand how the princess kept wanting to be rescued after all the nice things bowser got for her) After the player beats bowser, the pricess doesn't even thank mario or anything and just leaves him hanging while bowser gets rejected as well after they both try to ""win"" her by offering flowers. The ending ruined the whole buildup in my opinion.",Laurenz,negative
9544,Super Mario Odyssey,Switch,10,Just a great game overall. Everyone should give it a try. Its sad that such a great game gets some 0 user scores with absurd complaints and if you check their other reviews you see HZD 10/10 P5 10/10. Some people really need to stop being fanboys and just enjoy gaming.,RandomGuy102,negative
9545,Super Mario Odyssey,Switch,9,"This game was awesome I feel that all the levels where fun and I think that all them had a good amount of moons even though there is a ton of them you only need about 120ish to get to bowser.

But if you only go for the ending then you are missing out on an amazing package of charm and fun and it does make this game a bit of a ""its not the destination its the journey"" type games this would be a bigger problem if the journey wasn't so much fun there are so many new races or species or whatever. The controls where perfect and I felt at no time that when I died it was the game's fault when I died I felt like I made a mistake. Speaking of controls I found the motion controls pretty fun as well but this is probaly because I used the sperated JoyCons and not the ProControler so if you want to use a ProControler then you probally wont enjoy them as much the ideal way to play is with the JoyCons. There is something that gives the games controls the extra step to being perfection is Cappy. In this game your new sidekick is the hat ghost thing Cappy. With a press of the Y button or a flick of the JoyCon you can toss out your Felt Friend and grab coins and kill small baddies. The reason he only kills small foes is because when thrown at a normal sized enemies is that when Cappy is thrown at them he will ""Capture"" them, but its more like possesion because you go inside there bodies and take control of there brains. This adds a fun new twist onto gameplay and makes some fun boss battles based around these Captures. Another thing you can do with Cappy is when he is thrown you can dive onto him whi",Maxcarus,positive

9547,Super Mario Odyssey,Switch,10,"Super Mario Odyssey is undoubtedly a very easy game. However, it is only easy because it is free from the control and camera limitations of Super Mario 64 (as well as having no life limits, but that just takes away farming lives). The game isn't entirely without challenge, either... you just have to find the challenges.

The first thing to strike me was just how gorgeous the game looks. Nintendo continue to amaze me with what they can do with the power available in the Nintendo Switch.I'll not delve too deep into the story because it's a Mario game and by now I'm sure e all know roughly what the plot will entale. It's a fun story though that develops at a good pace. I'm going to concentrate on the gameplay because that's where this game really shines.Super Mario Odyssey takes place over a number of different kingdoms each having it's own unique feel and design. There's much more detail than you might first notice and there's plenty for you you to explore. The game world's have been expertly created as you might expect from Nintendo but they're just so clever in how they're done it's staggering.Super Mario Odyssey is a 3d game and the control scheme compliments it and works brilliantly, especially with the joycons. You can throw cappy (your new sidekick) by gesturing with the controllers and its on point with its responsiveness. Theres a wide variety of creatures for you to possess and doing so will help you to collect the in game currency and power moons that you require.Speaking of in game currency, each kingdom has its own unique currency that you",PrimalBanana,positive
